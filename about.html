<p> Agriculture was practiced for thousands of years without the use of artificial chemicals. Artificial fertilizers
were first developed during the mid-19th century. These early fertilizers were cheap, powerful, and easy to
transport in bulk. Similar advances occurred in chemical pesticides in the 1940s, leading to the decade being
referred to as the <b>'pesticide era'</b>. These new agricultural techniques, while beneficial in the
short-term, had serious longer-term side-effects such as soil compaction, erosion, and declines in overall soil
fertility, along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply.</p>
<p> Organic farming, also known as <b>ecological farming</b> or <b>biological farming</b>,is an agricultural system
that uses fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis
on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting.</p>
